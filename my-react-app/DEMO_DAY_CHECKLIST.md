### Common questions - Quick answers

**"How do you get the data?"**
→ "Simulated for demo. Production uses IoT sensors, weather APIs, and operator input."

**"What tech are you using?"**
→ "React 19, Mapbox GL, Vite. Frontend-focused MVP."

**"Who pays for this?"**
→ "Olympic organizers, NHL arenas, ski resorts. $5K-20K/month SaaS."

**"What's innovative?"**
→ "Combines sensors, AI, and geospatial in one view. Plus predictive insights."

**"Why winter sports?"**
→ "Climate change threatens winter sports. Better monitoring helps adapt."

### If stuck
- [ ] "Great question. Let me think..."
- [ ] Reference Beijing 2022 challenges
- [ ] Admit if you don't know, explain how you'd find out
